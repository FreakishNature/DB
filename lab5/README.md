In this exercise we need to declare 4 variables, give them random value. using the function rand() and to determine which number is the greatest using if statement. In this example I used check for two conditions for each value and in the statement I have the value assigment to the greatest one if condition was right.

This exercise is similar to ex1 with only 1 difference - we needed to use case statement instead of if. Constuction is simple case when(condition) then (assign some value ) ... .

In this exercise we needed to use try catch raiserror statements, for catching errors. We can get all information about the error that occured in try statement and process it in catch statement. In situation with raiserror we can create our own error in some particular situation like on image if grade equals 6 or 8.
